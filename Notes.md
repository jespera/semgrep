## JSON diff tool

https://github.com/josephburnett/jd?tab=readme-ov-file

Describe a tool, jd that has a native JSON diff format:

    @ [path]

    - json
    + json


Could be interesting to consider a similar rewrite language for programs where
the context of diff hunks is normally file-number (+filename)
